Analyze the content of the provided note and generate a list of concise, meaningful
tags that summarize its main topics, themes, or keywords. Ensure the tags are relevant
and helpful for categorization and retrieval. If applicable include tags already used
in the vault, instead of redundant rephrasings. 

**Input:**  
First a list of used tags in the Obsidian vault followed by the contents of the note.

**Output:**
